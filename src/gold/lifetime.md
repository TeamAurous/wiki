### Creating the server

1. Go to the **[Oracle Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)** page.

2. Scroll down under ***What are Always Free cloud services?*** and check the resources included in the always free offer: Arm-based Ampere A1 cores and 24 GB of memory usable as 1 VM or up to 4 VMs with 3,000 OCPU hours and 18,000 GB hours per month.

3. Press the **Start for Free** button and complete the registration process. You can create a [fake identity](https://fauxid.com/fake-name-generator) and [disposable email](https://smailpro.com/advanced), but the registration will require a credit card to complete.

4. You will be taken to a webpage with a purple banner indicating that you are on the free plan. Unless you specifically upgrade to a paid account, you will *not* be charged.

5. Under *Launch Resources*, select the **Create a VM instance** option. Give the instance a name.

6. Move down tho the *Image and Shape* box, and click **Edit**. Click **Change Image** and select the checkbox by **Canonical Ubuntu**. Set the OS version to **20.04**. Then click the blue **Select image** button.

7. Scroll down and click **Change shape**. Change the *Shape series* to **Ampere**. Scroll down and check the *VM.Standard.AI.Flex* default size, and increase the *Number of OCPUs* slider to **4**. A yellow *Service limits status* warning will appear, but you can proceed by pressing the blue **Select shape** button.

8. Scroll down to *Add SSH keys*, and select **Paste public keys**. Download and install **[PuTTY](https://putty.org/)**, and open an application called **PuTTYgen** (PuTTY Key Generator). Click **Generate** and paste the Public key into the website's *SSH keys* input field. 

9. Scroll down to *Boot volume* and click **Specify a custom boot volume size**. Set the *Boot volume size (GB)* input field to **200**. A yellow *Service limits status* warning will appear again, but you can proceed by pressing the **Create** button at the bottom.

10. You may see a red banner, *Out of capacity for shape VM.Standard.A1.Flex in availability domain*. If this happens, scroll back up to the *Placement* box and click **Edit**. Click a different *Avaliability domain* and try to click **Create** again.

11. Your server will now start provisioning. Return to *PuTTY Key Generator* and click **Save private key**; you will be using it to connect to the server via SSH. Save it to any file location.

!!!
For SSH setup *ONLY*, skip to Step 14.
!!!

12. Now that the server has finished provisioning, you need to allow RDP connections on port 3389. Under *Primary VNIC* click your *Subnet*. Then, under *Security Lists*, click the **Default Security List for vcn-...**. Click **Add Ingress Rules**. This should now open a modal for *Ingress Rule 1*.

13. In the *Source CIDR* field, type ***0.0.0.0/0***. In the *Destination Port Range - Optional* field, type ***3389***. In the *Description* field, type ***RDP***. Then, click **Add Ingress Rules**. You should now return to the Security List page. In your browser, click back twice to return to your instance dashboard.

### Setting up the VPS

14. Open PuTTY on your PC.

15. Under the *Host Name (or IP address)* field, enter the *Private IP address* of your instance. This can be found under *Primary VNIC* in your instance dashboard.

16. In the *Category* tree in PuTTY, navigate under `Connection` > `SSH` and click `Auth`, and click the **Browse** button under *Private key file for authentication* and select the .ppk file you saved earlier in PuTTYgen. Now scroll back up to *Session* in the Category tree. Enter a name under *Saved Sessions* and click **Save**. Now click **Open**. You may recieve a PuTTY Security Alert warning; click **Accept**.

17. Oracle will [reclaim your VM](https://i.imgur.com/W99gp9l.png) if your CPU, RAM, and Network usage is below 10%. To avoid this, please run the script below within a tmux session:
```sh
tmux
bash <(curl -s -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Ansen/e45320205faf5786d3282ac880f20bab/raw/onekey-NeverIdle.sh)
# leave tmux by pressing Ctrl+B D
```

!!!danger 
Stop here if you want to use this server for terminal only. You can now connect to your VPS with PuTTY. [Use tmux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl7NFenTgIo) to keep programs running after closing SSH.
!!!

!!!
To use it as a portable desktop (*install a DE*), please continue:
!!!

1.  In the PuTTY window, enter the following commands. Click **<Yes>** (enter) on popups when nessecary.
    ```sh
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop xrdp stacer -y   #  You can alternatively use kubuntu-desktop for KDE
    sudo cp /etc/iptables/rules.v4 /etc/iptables/rules.v4.bak && sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/iptables/rules.v4
    sudo rm /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.color.policy
    ```

2.  Type: `sudo passwd ubuntu`, and enter a new password for your RDP connection. Now type `sudo reboot`.

### Setting up RDP

20. Open **Remote Desktop Connection** in Windows. Click **Show Options**. In the *Computer* field, enter the *Private IP address* of your instance. In the *User name* field, enter **ubuntu**. Check the **Allow me to save credentials** box.

21. Go to the *Local Resources* tab. Under *Local devices and resources*, ensure only **Clipboard** is checked, and **Printers** is unchecked.

22. Click **Connect**. You may get a *The identity of the remote computer cannot be verified* warning. Check **Don't ask me again** and click **Yes**. A Windows Security window will pop up. Enter the password you created earlier and click **OK**. You will now be in the Ubuntu desktop.

23. If you are using *GNOME* (`ubuntu-desktop`), open *Settings*, *`Privacy` > `Screen Lock`*, and change *Blank Screen Delay* to **Never**, disable *Automatic Screen Lock*, disable *Lock Screen on Suspend*, and disable *Show Notifications on Lock Screen*.

	If you are using *KDE* (`kubuntu-desktop`), open *System Settings*, search *`Screen Locking`*, and and uncheck the boxes by *Lock screen automatically*.

24. To optimize RDP, open a terminal window and paste the following commands:
- Set animations in Ubuntu (GNOME only):
    - Disable animations:
    ```sh
    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false
    ```
    - ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo *(if nessecary)*:
    ```sh
    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations true
    ```
- Change the number of colors that XRDP has to transmit:
    - Reduce colors:
    ```sh
    sudo sed -i 's/max_bpp=32/max_bpp=16/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini && sudo reboot
    ```
    - ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo *(if nessecary)*:
    ```sh
    sudo sed -i 's/max_bpp=16/max_bpp=32/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini && sudo reboot
    ```
- If your RDP is still slow: return to the *Remote Desktop Connection* Windows client, and go to the *Experience* tab. Set dropdown under *Choose your connection speed to optimize performance* to **LAN (10Mbits or higher)**.

25. Open Stacer to prove the CPU Cores (4), Memory (23.4 GiB), and Disk size (193.6 GiB).

You can now access your VPS from anywhere in the world using **Remote Desktop Connection**. *You can optionally set up X11 Forwarding by following the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlHVuA_98SA).*

To monitor the performance of the Ubuntu instance, you can use a graphical performance monitor like **Stacer**, which will show you the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and disk storage available.
